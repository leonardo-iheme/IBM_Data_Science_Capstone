    "# 1.1 Background\n",
    "In this report, I will outline the steps I took to discover similar and dissimilar coffee-neighborhoods in Istanbul locals' favorite districts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Istanbul is one of the biggest and most populous cities in the world, the only city that exists on two continents. Both parts of the city are divided by the Bosphorous strait. Two Districts loved by Istanbul residents are Beşiktaş (be-shik-tash) and Kadıköy (ka-di-koy) on the European and Asian side respectively. While these districts have a lot in common, they have their fair share of differences as well, the surge of coffee shops for one. In fact, according to [Foursquare](https://foursquare.com/top-places/istanbul/best-places-coffee), [8 of 15 best coffee shops in Istanbul are located in Beşiktaş and Kadıköy]\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a fierce debate among residents about the neighborhood to best enjoy a cup of coffee. This report will address the issue by providing insights drawn from data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1.2 Problem Statement\n",
    "After tea, coffee is the next most consumed beverage in the country and that is for good reason. In modern Istanbul, to escape the tourist traps and mingle with locals, the best places to have a coffee are Beşiktaş and Kadıköy. As a visitor, finding a venue and neighborhood to have a coffee can be quite difficult given the wide range of choices and factors. \n",
    "\n",
    "This study will be of interest to both visitors of Istanbul and locals who yet to discover the hidden similarities between the two most sought after neighborhoods. The report will help readers to:\n",
    "1. Be more familiar with the discussed neighborhoods\n",
    "2. Understand the relationship between coffee shops and other neighborhood attributes\n",
    "3. Discover the similarities between neighborhoods in terms of coffee shops and other attributes\n",
    "4. Be able to make better-informed decisions about where to coffee in Istanbul like a resident"

    "All the data used in this project were obtained from various sources on the internet. While some were ready to use, others had to be wrangled and cleaned. Data manipulation was performed with _Python_, using mostly the _Pandas_ library. The data was collected towards building the attributes of each neighborhood bearing in mind the factors that could affect a coffee experience. It is worth noting that the data may be limited in some cases because I used free tier accounts but it gives a good sense of proportions.\n",
    "## 2.1 Population & Demographics Data\n",
    "Since the region of interest (ROI) has been narrowed down to Beşiktaş and Kadıköy, I could crawl the web and scrape using _beautiful soup_ to obtain such information as: \n",
    "* The list of neighborhoods in each district,\n",
    "* The population of each neighborhood, and\n",
    "* The average price of residential rent at each neighborhood\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.2 Geographical Data\n",
    "To locate the neighborhoods, I leveraged on Google Maps API and the [Open Street maps project](https://www.openstreetmap.org). The information obtained from the respective sources are as follows:\n",
    "* Google maps: coordinates as longitude and latitude pairs\n",
    "* Open street maps: neighborhood boundaries as polygon coordinates which were then converted to *geojson* files using an API provided by [geojson.io](http://geojson.io/)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.3 Location Data\n",
    "The list of coffee shops was obtained by querying [foursquare](https://foursquare.com/) through the API. As I use a free tier account, the results of my queries were limited in some cases.\n",
    "##  \n",
    "The features which will be extracted from the data include the **number of coffee shops per neighborhood, the average distance from the center of the neighborhood to the seaside, the estimated number of people served by a coffee shop in each neighborhood, and the socioeconomic status of each neighborhood**. With the extracted features, exploratory as well as inferential data analysis will be carried out. Finally, the neighborhoods will be clustered using machine learning."

    "I started by searching the internet for the list of neighborhoods and their respective postal codes.

    "kadikoy = requests.get(r\"https://www.bulurum.com/en/post-codes/kadikoy/istanbul/\").text\n",

    "To detect similar neighborhoods based on the extracted features, an un-supervised machine learning modelis trained. Specifically, K-means clustering is used to divide all the neighborhoods into five groups. The reason for choosing five is, I imagine that, as a visitor, you have five days to spend in the city and you want to have a totally different coffee experience (like a local) everyday, this algorithm will help objectively guide you to selecting five neighborhoods in Beşiktaş and Kadıköy that will deliver different experiences.  \n",

    "The preceeding sections of the report have shown how complex the neighborhoods are. Specifically, the data exploratory section reveals that some unforseen traits such as the variation found in Kadıköy in contrast to Beşiktaş. In particular, the varying cost of living, while Beşiktaş is a more exensive neighborhood than Kadıköy, the scale in Kadıköy is spread out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the likelihood of finding a wider range of coffee is higher in Beşiktaş than Kadıköy since there are more coffee shops in the neighborhoods of Beşiktaş. In Kadıköy, the distance of the neighborhoods from the coast seems to be negetively correlated with the number of coffee shops and positively correlated with the cost of rent.\n",

    "The clustering analysis revealed the similar neighborhoods. For instance, according to the results of clustering, neighborhoods in clusters three and four have the most number of coffee shops as shown in the violin plot below\n",

    "# 6 Conclusion and Future Work\n",
    "In this report, I have outlined the findings of both exporatory data analysis and inferential data analysis. Using several data gathering and wrangling techniques, features of two of the most loved by locals districts of Istanbul were analyzed. Furthermore, machine learning was applied to find the neighborhoods that were most similar. The aim of the study was not to say which neighborhood was better but to serve as a guide to those seeking to get a specific coffee experience. I leave it to the reader to decide where and how to have coffee given the forgone analysis and their preference.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many avnues for improving the work that has been done. One would be improving the quality of data by acquiring it from sources that do not limit the amout that can be collected. With such data, one will have the means to perform more sophisticated and accurate analysis. With information such as the customer reviews, sentiment analysis can be carried out."
